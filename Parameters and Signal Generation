% Parameters
sf = 7; % Spreading Factor (typically between 7 and 12 for LoRa)
bw = 125e3; % Bandwidth (125 kHz is common for LoRa)
fs = bw; % Sampling frequency

% Derived parameters
n = 2^sf; % Number of chips (or chirps)
T_symbol = n / bw; % Symbol duration

% Time vector for one symbol
t = (0:n-1) / fs;

% Example data to modulate (symbol values from 0 to 2^sf-1)
data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; % Example data
num_symbols = length(data);
